Building a flashcard system with Angular 2 for learning purposes

This is app is a bit rough around the edges right now, but is essentially
a flashcard system built solely in Angular 2. Data is being stored on an 
mLabs MongoDB database. As it stands right now though, all of the business
logic, data-storage logic and everything(!) is implemented on the front-end.
This, obviously, is not ideal, but the point of this project was to build
competency with Angular 2 on the front-end to build a functional app.

In the future, I intend to integrate this project with Phoenix on the
backend to make a more robust system.
